## Getting Started

clone project from githun repository

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/RedberryInternship/levan-tchelishvili-movie-quotes
```
Run composer install to install dependencies
```bash
  composer install
```
Install JS dependencies
```bash
  npm run dev
```

Now we need to set our env file. Go to the root of your project and execute this command.
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```
Update .env file



mysql

`DB_CONNECTION=mysql`

`DB_HOST=127.0.0.1`

`DB_PORT=3306`

`DB_DATABASE=*****`

`DB_USERNAME=*****`

`DB_PASSWORD=*****`

after setting up .enc run command 

```bash
 php artisan key:generate
```
Which generates auth key.

#### Now, you should be good to go!

### Migration
if you've completed getting started section, then migrating database if fairly simple process, just execute:

```bash
php artisan migrate
```


### Development
You can run Laravel's built-in development server by executing:

```bash
php artisan serve
```
when working on JS you may run:

 ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```
it builds your js files into executable scripts. If you want to watch files during development, execute instead:
```bash
  npm run watch
```
it will watch JS files and on change it'll rebuild them, so you don't have to manually build them.
